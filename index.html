    <h1>All About Deborah</h1>
    <p>Born in Portland and raised mostly in the Pacific Northwest I am most comfortable in green, rainy climes.  However, I do appreciate warmer weather as well, especially since it means dry dogs.  I share my home with three dogs, and winter means muddy footprints and damp fur in our house.  </p>
    <p>One thing I enjoy is studying languages.  I have studied Greek, Latin, French, and Italian.  I grew up in a family firmly entrenched in technology and often joked that while my mom learned C++ I buried myself in Greek.  We just spoke diferent languages.  Just please do not ask me to hold a conversation in any of these because I am horribly out of practice.  </p>
